											For my final year AI module, I was tasked with implementing an example of Artificial Life in the form of flocking. I did this by following the model first published by Craig Reynolds using the simple rules of 'seperation', 'alignment' and 'cohesion' in order to create the complex behaviour that is flocking.
											<br>I then took this a step further by implementing a predator into the simulation that kills the 'birds'. This allowed me to further develop the model as I could grant each bird different characteristics, in order to observe which best suited survival in the given environment.
											This could be developed further using evolutionary algorithms in order to 'breed' the best birds of each generation in order to improve the characteristics of the birds going into the next generation, until they can survive against the predator.

											As part of my second year AI module, I constructed the AI required to navigate a tank through a given maze while also collecting objectives and reacting to enemies. 
											<br>To achieve these requirements, I implemented a range of steering behaviours (namely, 'Seek', 'Flee', 'Arrive', 'Pursue', 'Avoid' and 'Wander'), and combined these with both DRS Pathfinding and obstacle avoidance. In combination, these granted by AI the ability to navigate through the maze in a timely manner without colliding with the walls of the maze.
											<br>In reaction to spotted enemies, the AI located the nearest safe spot, and navigates to it while also shooting the the enemy if its gun is correctly aimed at it. This allowed the tank to pass through the enemies located in the maze while only taking minimal damage and conserving ammo.

											In a project I worked on with four other students, we produced a first person puzzle game in UE4 which took inspiration from the 'Portal' series. The game consisted on the player being able to colour certain objects within the world, which each colour providing different traits that affect its surroundings. The player would have to strategically make their way through the puzzels, unlocking additional colours as they progress in order to produce new ways of completing puzzles. 
											This project allowed us to further develop our skills with UE4 while also granting us experience in multiple areas we had not experienced before, or had little knowledge on (such as UI, collisions, shaders, etc).

										<h2>Rigidbody Physics:</h2>

											For my graphics and physics module in second year, I was assigned with creating a rigidbody physics engine in Direct3D that focused on realistic collision interactions between 3D objects. Collisions were originally handled using only simple bounding spheres and boxes, however when implementing many objects in the world this caused the collision code to come to a crawl as I was having to run the collision code O(N^2) as each object had to be compared against every other object. To fix this issue, I used the bounding spheres and boxes alongside a basic octree implemention to reduce the amount of needed collision checks.
											<br>In addition to the rigidbody collisions, I also implemented a particle system which makes use of a object pool in order to cut down on the amount of memory allocations taking place.

											As my second venture into games programming, this 'Super Mario Bros' clone introduced me to the SDL2 Library, game audio and also very basic enemy AI. This project was also my first attempt at implementing a text renderer from scratch.

											This was the first game that I created and it was done using the Universities proprietary API called S2D. It is a basic two player clone of 'Bomberman' with various power ups dropped from the crates when they are designed. While basic, it intoduced me to the fundamentals of games programming and a better understanding of what goes into making a game.
